                        <p>
                            We started Manage with the unwavering belief that great people build outstanding products.
                            Back then, we knew that just hosting a group of talented people on our premises was not enough. We needed to build an environment where unique individuals were empowered to put in their best work and leave a piece of their hearts.
                            We wanted to create a philosophy, a craft, a way of life. And that's how Manage was born.</p>
